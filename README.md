# Stopwatch-Timer
This is my first Task (Stopwatch and Timer) of my internship delivered by Code Clause.
DESCRIPTION:

A stopwatch is a timepiece designed to measure the time elapsed from a particular time when activated and when the piece is deactivated. It measures the time between two events, such as a race or a test. A stopwatch can also provide additional information about the elapsed processor ticks or the accuracy of the measurement1.

A timer is a timepiece designed to measure a certain period of time, such as a cooking time or a deadline. It can also execute some tasks in certain time intervals without blocking anything, such as sounding an alarm or turning off a device
